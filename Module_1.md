# Study Guide: Introduction to Programming

Your first practice quiz is coming up soon. This handy study guide should help you prepare for that quiz. The practice quizzes do not count towards your grade in this course. Practice quizzes are opportunities for you to check your understanding of the materials before you take the graded assessments at the end of each module.

# Key Terms

- **Programming code** - Programming code is a set of written computer instructions, guided by rules, using a computer programming language. It might help to think of the computer instructions as a detailed, step-by-step recipe for performing tasks. The instructions tell computers and machines how to perform an action. Programming code may also be referred to as source code or scripts.
- **Programming languages** - Programming languages are similar to human spoken languages in that they both use syntax and semantics. Programming languages are used to write computer programs. Some common programming languages include Python, Java, C, C++, C#, and R.
- **Syntax** - Syntax is a set of rules for how statements are constructed in both human and computer languages. Programming syntax includes rules for the order of elements in programming instructions, as well as the use of special characters and their placements in statements. This concept is similar to the syntax rules for grammar and punctuation in human language.
- **Semantics** - Semantics refers to the intended meaning or effect of statements, or collections of words, in both human and computer languages. Semantic errors are also referred to as logical errors.
- **Computer program** - A computer program is a step-by-step list of instructions that a computer follows to reach an intended goal. It is important to be clear and precise about the actions a computer program is supposed to perform because computers will do exactly what they are instructed to do. Computer programs can be long, complex, and accomplish a variety of tasks. They are often developed by computer programmers and software engineers, but anyone can learn to create them. Computer programs may involve a structured development cycle. They can be written in a wide variety of programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, R, and more. The completed format of a program is often a single executable file.
- **Script** - Scripts are usually shorter and less complex than computer programs. Scripts are often used to automate specific tasks. However, they can be used for complex tasks if needed. Scripts are often written by IT professionals, but anyone can learn to write scripts. Scripts have a shorter, less structured development cycle as compared to the development of complex computer programs and software. Scripts can be written in a variety of programming languages, like Python, Javascript, Ruby, Bash, and more. Some scripting languages are interpreted languages and are only compatible with certain platforms.
- **Automation** - Automation is used to replace a repetitive manual step with one that happens automatically.
- **Output** - Output is the end result of a task performed by a function or computer program. Output can include a single value, a report, entries into a database, and more.
- **Input** - Input is information that is provided to a program by the end user. Input can be text, voice, images, biometrics, and more.
- **Functions** A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.
- **Variables** - Variables are used to temporarily store changeable values in programming code.

# Python Resources

## **More About Python**

### **Using Python on your own**

The best way to learn any programming language is to practice it on your own as much as you can. If you have Python installed on your computer, you can execute the interpreter by running the python3 command (or just python on Windows), and you can close it by typing exit() or Ctrl-D.

If you don’t already have Python installed on your machine, that’s alright. We’ll explain how to install it in an upcoming course.

### **Python practice resources**

In the meantime, you can still practice by using one of the many online Python interpreters or codepads available online. There’s not much difference between an interpreter and a codepad. An interpreter is more interactive than a codepad, but they both let you execute code and see the results.

Below, you’ll find links to some of the most popular online interpreters and codepads. Give them a go to find your favorite.

- https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_interpreter
- https://repl.it/languages/python3
- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_python3_online.php
- https://rextester.com/l/python3_online_compiler
- https://trinket.io/python3

### **Additional Python resources**

While this course will give you information about how Python works and how to write scripts in Python, you’ll likely want to find out more about specific parts of the language. Here are some great ways to help you find additional info:

- Read the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/).
- Search for answers or ask a question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
- Subscribe to the Python [tutor](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor) mailing list, where you can ask questions and collaborate with other Python learners.
- Subscribe to the [Python-announce](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-announce-list) mailing list to read about the latest updates in the language.

### **Python history and current status**

Python was released almost 30 years ago and has a rich history. You can read more about it on the [History of Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Python) Wikipedia page or in the section on the [history of the software](https://docs.python.org/3.0/license.html) from the official Python documentation.

Python is a rapidly evolving language, with new versions released regularly to introduce fresh features, enhance performance, address security vulnerabilities, and improve overall usability. While these updates drive innovation, they can sometimes require adjustments to existing code. Fortunately, Python offers tools to facilitate the migration process. For this course, we will be using Python 3.7. ****To stay up to date on the most current release of Python or find a specific release, you can visit [Python's website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

# A Note on Syntax and Code Blocks

When writing code, using correct syntax is critical. Even a small typo, like a missing parenthesis bracket or an extra comma, can cause a syntax error and the code won't execute at all. If your code results in an error or an exception, pay close attention to syntax and watch out for minor mistakes. A single wrong character could take hours to identify in long code so it is important to be mindful of syntax when writing code.

## **Common syntax errors:**

- Misspellings
- Incorrect indentations
- Missing or incorrect key characters:
    - Bracket types - ( curved ), [ square ], { curly }
    - Quote types - "straight-double" or 'straight-single', “curly-double” or ‘curly-single’
    - Block introduction characters, like colons - :
- Data type mismatches
- Missing, incorrectly used, or misplaced Python reserved words
- Using the wrong case (uppercase/lowercase) - Python is a case-sensitive language

If your syntax is correct, but the script has unexpected behavior or output, this may be due to a semantic problem. Syntax is like the vocabulary, grammar, spelling, and punctuation of code. Semantics are the meaning and logic of coded statements. It is possible to have syntactically correct code that runs successfully, but doesn't do what we want it to do.

## **Common semantic errors:**

- Creating functional code, but getting unintentional output
- Poor logic structures in the design of the code

When working with the code blocks in exercises for this course, be mindful of syntax and semantic (logic) errors, along with the overall result of your code. Just because you fixed an error doesn't mean that the code will have the desired effect when it runs! Once you’ve fixed an error in your code, don't forget to click Run to check your work.

# Study Guide: Introduction to Python

This study guide provides a quick-reference summary of what you learned in this lesson and serves as a guide for the upcoming practice quiz.

In this segment, you learned that Python is a general purpose programming language that is commonly used for scripting and automation, as well as to develop a wide variety of applications. Python is compatible with most operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS, and is updated every few years. Python can also run on a variety of machines, such as servers, workstations, PCs, mobile devices, IoT, and more.

Python is widely used in the IT field, including IT support, system administration, web development, machine learning, data analytics, and more. Python can be used to calculate statistics, run your e-commerce site, process images, interact with web services, and do a whole host of other tasks. Python instructions resemble the English language, which is what makes it easier to learn and understand when compared to other programming languages.

**Python is:**

- a general purpose scripting language;
- a popular language used to code a variety of applications;
- a frequently used tool for automation;
- a cross-platform compatible language;
- a beginner-friendly language.

**Python is not:**

- a platform-specific / OS-specific scripting language;
- a client-side scripting language;
- a purely object-oriented programming language.

## Code comparison with Python

You will be learning about both Python and Bash scripting in this program. The following code illustrates a syntax difference between the two languages:

![image.png](attachment:85c95961-fd2d-4f47-b492-6f2233d8ce53:image.png)

# Key Terms

- **Platform-specific / OS specific scripting language** Platform-specific scripting languages, like PowerShell (for Windows) and Bash (for Linux), are used by system administrators on those platforms.
- **Client-side scripting language** - Client-side scripting languages, like JavaScript, are used mostly for web programming. The scripts are transferred from a web server to the end-user’s internet browser, then executed in the browser.
- **Machine language** - Machine language is the lowest-level computer language. It communicates directly with computing machines in binary code (ones and zeros). In binary code, one equals a pulse of electricity and zero equals no electrical pulse. Machine language instructions are made from translating languages like Python into complex patterns of ones and zeros.
- **Cross-platform** **language** Programming language that is compatible with one or more platforms / operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, Android).
- **Object-oriented programming language** - In object-oriented programming languages, most coding elements are considered to be objects with configurable properties. For example, a form field is an object that can be configured to accept only dates as input in the mm/dd/yy format, and can be configured to read from and write to a specific database.
- **Python interpreter -** An interpreter is the program that reads and executes Python code by translating Python code into computer instructions.

# Study Guide: First Programming Concepts

This study guide provides a quick-reference summary of what you learned in this lesson and serves as a guide for the upcoming practice quiz.

# Functions

A function is a piece of code that performs a unit of work. In the examples you've seen so far, you have only encountered the **print()** function, which outputs a message to the screen. You will use this function frequently in this course to check the results of your code. The syntax of the print() function is modeled in the example below.

![image.png](attachment:98c417b2-0763-4db7-9ca4-06db4622acb0:image.png)

# Keywords

A keyword is a reserved word in a programming language that performs a specific purpose. In your first Python example, you briefly encountered the keywords **for** and **in**.  Note that keywords will often appear in **bold** in this course.

In the next few weeks, you will also learn the following keywords:

Values: **True**, **False**, **None**
Conditions: **if**, **elif**, **else**
Logical operators: **and**, **or**, **not**
Loops: **for**, **in**, **while**, **break**, **continue**
Functions: **def**, **return**

You don't need to learn this whole list now. We'll dive into each keyword as we encounter them. There are additional reserved keywords in Python. If you would like to read about them, please visit the linked “Python Keywords” article in the Resources section at the end of this study guide.

# Arithmetic operators

Python can calculate numbers using common mathematical operators, along with some special operators, too:

**x + y**            Addition + operator returns the sum of x plus y
**x - y**             Subtraction - operator returns the difference of x minus y
**x * y**            Multiplication * operator returns the product of x times y
**x / y**             Division / operator returns the quotient of x divided by y
**x**y**            Exponent ** operator returns the result of raising x to the power of y 
**x**2**            Square expression returns x squared
**x**3**            Cube expression returns x cubed
**x**(1/2)**    ****Square root (½) or (0.5) fractional exponent operator returns the square root of x
**x // y**           Floor division operator returns the integer part of the integer division of x by y
**x % y**          Modulo operator returns the remainder part of the integer division of x by y

## Order of operations

The order of operations are to be calculated from left to right in the following order:

1. **P**arentheses ( ), { }, [ ]
2. **E**xponents xy (x**y)
3. **M**ultiplication * and **D**ivision /
4. **A**ddition + and **S**ubtraction -

You might find the **PEMDAS** mnemonic device to be helpful in remembering the order.

Code editors are tools used to make writing code easier. With a code editor, you can write, debug and execute programs in Python. Code editors provide features, including syntax highlighting, automatic indentation, error checking, and auto-completion. Overall, code editors help define the code structure and function. This allows you to write code more efficiently. They also make it easier to understand variables, commands, functions, and loops. VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks and CoLab are some of the code editors we will cover in the next few videos. IDEs have more features than code editors. The difference between a code editor and an IDE is that a code editor is like a text editor. IDEs provide direction in writing code and allow you to see how the code executes. You can think of a code editor like a landline phone. You can dial numbers and make phone calls with it. An IDE is more like a smartphone. You can still make phone calls, but it has additional features that allow you to make video calls, send text messages, browse the Internet and use lots of other applications. An IDE is a software tool that simplifies the process of creating a new software application. An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development. IDEs always include a code editor. IDEs allow you to develop code more efficiently by bringing multiple tools into one environment. You'll be able to edit, build, test and package all in one application. They also allow you to program applications more quickly without having to add manual integration and configuration.

# Review: Use the command-line

The command-line is used to tell your computer what to do. You can use it to access servers, move files, change directories, and write scripts. In this reading, you will learn how to write Python scripts at the command-line along with the Python GUI IDLE. We will also cover the different ways you can access the command-line based on your operating system.

## **Using the command line on MacOS**

Using the spotlight search, type in “terminal.” Select the terminal application. You should see your username followed by the $ sign. MacOS comes with Python 2.7 pre-installed. You can install Python 3 from [python.org](http://python.org/). Just remember, this means that you will have 2 versions of Python installed on your Mac, and you will need to pay special attention to your paths.

To check which version of Python you have installed on your Mac, use the following command.

**python --version**

To check for Python3, use the following command.

**python3 --version**

## **Using the command line on Windows OS**

In Windows, open the start menu. In the search box type cmd. Right-click on cmd and select Run as administrator. This will open up the command-line. Windows OS does not come with Python installed. Visit the official Python [download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) for Windows. Select the Windows installer (64-bit) or (32-bit). After the installer is downloaded, double–click the file. Select **Install launcher for all users**. Follow the prompts during installation. Make sure to select the **Add python.exe PATH** checkbox. This will allow you to launch Python from the command line. Once installation is complete, you can check for Python from the command line.

To check for Python, use the following command. The version of Python you installed will appear.

**python --version**

## **Using the command line on Linux OS**

Access the Linux terminal using Ctrl + Alt + T. This will allow you to check for Python. Type python. Python comes preinstalled on most Linux systems. If the command is not found, you can install Python by writing sudo apt install python3.

You can begin writing Python code from the terminal. Simply type python to use the interactive mode. You can also write Python scripts using Linux with IDLE which we will cover next.

## **Using IDLE**

Python IDLE is included with Python installations on Windows and MacOS. You can download IDLE using your package manager on Linux. Python IDLE is an interactive interpreter or file editor that allows you to easily write Python scripts and programs. IDLE provides syntax highlighting, code completion, and automatic indentation.

Double click on the IDLE icon to open it on your computer. This will open a blank Python interpreter window. You can begin writing code right away.

![image.png](attachment:5b76cee4-9059-4f3a-92b6-27640dc5fb91:image.png)

You can also open a new file. Go to File → Open → New File from the menu bar. Here you can write a Python file. Once you have completed writing your Python code in the file, go to File → Save As. Give your Python file a name. Hit Save. To run the Python code in the file you saved click Run → Run Module from the menu.

![image.png](attachment:b97ecf11-257c-4d88-8ec6-401854fd19ee:image.png)

![image.png](attachment:5f275cad-7ee8-482f-be6d-abebe6982c88:image.png)

## **Key takeaways**

Whichever operating system you are using, you will be able to run Python from the command-line.  Using a text editor like IDLE and running python from the command-line  is best for executing and debugging individual scripts or .py files.

## **Resources for more information**

Here is a list of additional resources for writing and running Python on your local machine.

- A [guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-quick-guide-to-using-command-line-terminal-96815b97b955) to using terminal (command-line) on Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems.

# Review: Use JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks

There are many different places and environments that you can use to write and run code.  In this video, you will learn more about JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks to write, run, and debug Python code. JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebooks are part of an open source project called [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and are free to use.

## **JupyterLab**

JupyterLab is a web-based interface that allows you to use Jupyter Notebooks to write, run, and debug Python code. JupyterLab is an online environment that allows you to run your code in the cloud.

## **Jupyter Notebook**

Jupyter Notebook can be used and run in the web-based interface through [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/) or on your local machine. Jupyter Notebook allows you to create documents that contain live code. You can write Python programs and scripts using Jupyter Notebooks and see how they execute all in one place. It is a great tool for creating and understanding the code you are writing because you can see your input and output all in one spot.

# Review: Use Colab

Colab Notebooks are Jupyter Notebooks that are hosted by Google’s Colaboratory. In Colab, you can write and run Python code. In this reading, you will learn more about how to use Colab and its features.

## **About Colab**

Colab is a web-based platform that allows you to write and run Python code really quickly in Google Drive. It is free and  ready to use with zero configuration required. You can simply visit [Colab](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb) to get started!

## **Colab’s Features**

Colab provides all of the functionality that Python offers. The cells within Colab can include code, text, and images. The code cells include executable code and rich text which make it easy to write and run code. Colab also makes it easy to include markdown in your notebooks. This is a great feature for sharing notebooks because you can add headings, paragraphs, lists, mathematical formulas, and more. You can install Python packages using the pip command within the code cell. Colab Notebooks can easily be shared with other collaborators, too.

Note: When you create a Colab Notebook it is stored in your Google Drive. You can easily share using the share button in the upper right hand corner of the notebook.

# Review: Use VS Code

VS code is an open source code editor that includes developer tooling. It is similar to Jupyter Notebooks and Colab, but it includes more features. VS code provides built-in support with [Intellisense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense#:~:text=IntelliSense%20is%20a%20general%20term,%2C%20and%20%22code%20hinting.%22) code completion, an interactive debugger, and other build and scripting tools. VS code has a simple design that is easy to use. Its intuitive features make it a great choice for coding in Python!

## **Using VS Code with Python**

To use VS code for Python, you will need to have Python3, VS Code, and the VS Code Python extension installed. Make sure that you have Python3 installed on your computer by typing the following command in the terminal on your computer.

Linux/macOS: open a Terminal Window and type the following command:

**python3 --version**

Windows: open a command prompt and run the following command:

**py -3 --version**

If Python3 is installed the output should look like this:

**$python3 -- version**

**Python 3.11.3**

If it is not installed the output will look like this:

**$python3 -- version**

# Reminder: Correct syntax is critical

Using precise syntax is critical when writing code in any programming language, including Python. Even a small typo can cause a syntax error and the automated Python-coded quiz grader will mark your code as incorrect. This reflects real-life coding errors in the sense that a single error in spelling, case, punctuation, etc. can cause your code to fail. Coding problems caused by imprecise syntax will always be an issue whether you are learning a programming language or you are using programming skills on the job. So, it is critical to start the habit of being precise in your code now.

No credit will be given if there are any coding errors on the automated graded quizzes - including minor errors. Fortunately, you have 3 optional retake opportunities on the graded quizzes in this course. Additionally, you have unlimited retakes on practice quizzes and can review the videos and readings as many times as you need to master the concepts in this course.

Now, before starting the graded quiz, review this list of common syntax errors coders make when writing code.

### **Common syntax errors:**

- Misspellings
- Incorrect indentations
- Missing or incorrect key characters:
    - Parenthetical types - ( curved ), [ square ], { curly }
    - Quote types - "straight-double" or 'straight-single', “curly-double” or ‘curly-single’
    - Block introduction characters, like colons - :
- Data type mismatches
- Missing, incorrectly used, or misplaced Python reserved words
- Using the wrong case (uppercase/lowercase) - Python is a case-sensitive language
